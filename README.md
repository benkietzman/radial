Provides a radial design with a central hub and adjunct interfaces.

Within the code you will notice the following short keys used within JSON associative arrays:

* _d:  destination - Designates the flow of the request.  Either toward the target (t) or source (s).
* _f:  function - Designates an internal function.
* _l:  link - Contains an internally imbedded request transmitted across links.
* _s:  source - Designates the source interface of the request.
* _t:  target - Designates the target interface of the request.
* _r:  request - Contains an internally imbedded request transmitted across interfaces.
